I want this blog to serve two purposes.  First, it should briefly show Python code that will be helpful to experimental psychologits.  And second, I want to share some cool pics of me, my wife, and my two kids.  To begin, I'll start with the latter.

The first picture shows Leonardo.  He is 18 months old in this picture and loves frosting.  Not the cupcake.  He'd throw that away, if he could.  He just the frosting.  Any frosting would do. 

<div class="card mb-3">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="/theme/img/Leo-with-frosting.jpg"/>
    <div class="card-body bg-light">
        <div class="card-text">
            Leonardo eating frosting on a cupcake, but not the cupcake itself.

The second picture shows Vincent.  On 10/19/2025, he said that he wanted to draw.  Which he normally does not like to do.  But drew a Tesla Cybertruck....all by himself and colored it in.  The next day, he wanted to add trees, but he was sick.  More likely, he was distracted by the TV and watched toy car restoration videos instead.
