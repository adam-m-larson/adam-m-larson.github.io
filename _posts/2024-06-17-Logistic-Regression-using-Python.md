I analyze data published in [Larson and Loschky (2009)](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2122327).  The study examines the contributions of differt parts of our visual field to categorizing an image's setting (for example, an image could depict a "City", "Park", or "home").  The python code briefly summarizes the study and its findings.  Afterwards, I use Python and the statsmodel library to analyze the data using a logistic regression.  This [link to github repository](https://github.com/adam-m-larson/Logistic-Regression-Analysis-with-Larson-and-Loschky-2009-) contains the raw data in a .csv file and the python code in an .ipynb.
