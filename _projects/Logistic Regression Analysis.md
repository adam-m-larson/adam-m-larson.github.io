## About

I analyze data published in [Larson and Loschky (2009)](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2122327).  The study examines the contributions of differt parts of our visual field to categorizing an image's setting (for example, an image could depict a "City", "Park", or "home").  The python code briefly summarizes the study and its findings.  Afterwards, I use Python and the statsmodel library to analyze the data using a logistic regression.  This [link to github repository](https://github.com/adam-m-larson/Logistic-Regression-Analysis-with-Larson-and-Loschky-2009-) contains the raw data in a .csv file and the python code in an .ipynb.

This script will focus on:

1. Providing a summary of the research examining how central and peripheral vision contributes to the task of scene classification
2. Computing descriptive statistics from the data collected
3. Analyzing the data using logistic regression
4. Visualizing the data
