Here's how to put a single image into a post, using a Bootstrap 4 card. This shows how to mingle Markdown with HTML, too.

<!--more-->

The card allows a caption to be aligned with the photo, and the card classes contain a `card-img-top` that ensures the image is responsive within the grid.

<div class="card mb-3">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/127767019/q%3D80_m%3D1500/v2?webp=true&sig=dd1fa4580c459472969cd4992068922f311f12cf263cf08b39615cfc1812286b"/>
    <div class="card-body bg-light">
        <div class="card-text">
            The Peak District on a mosty morning.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

The HTML source for this card is below, or of course you could look at the raw source for this file in the GitHub repo or on your disk after you have downloaded the repo. WHen looking at the source, you can see the Markdown mingled with the HTML.

{% highlight html %}

<div class="card mb-3">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/127767019/q%3D80_m%3D1500/v2?webp=true&sig=dd1fa4580c459472969cd4992068922f311f12cf263cf08b39615cfc1812286b"/>
    <div class="card-body bg-light">
        <div class="card-text">
            The Peak District on a mosty morning.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Here's how to use the Entypo icons in the Friday Theme as SVGs It's easy with Jekyll's include tag and Bootstrap 4 classes.

<!--more-->

Bootstrap 3 shipped with the Glyphicons built-in as icon files and accompanying CSS classes. Bootstrap 4 doesn't have these, but does point you to some SVG icon libraries. With Jekyll's include and Bootstrap 4's flex layout, it's easy to use the SVGs inline without writing lots of icon-related CSS.

## Example

<p class="d-flex align-items-center">
    <span class="icon grey mr-2" markdown="0">
        {% include entypo/clock.svg %}
    </span>
    A clock icon in grey left-aligned
</p>

<p class="d-flex align-items-center">
    A cycle icon in red right-aligned
    <span class="icon red ml-2" markdown="0">
        {% include entypo/cycle.svg %}
    </span>
</p>

## Source

{% highlight markdown %}
{% raw %}

<p class="d-flex align-items-center">
    <span class="icon grey mr-2">
        {% include entypo/clock.svg %}
    </span>
    A clock icon in grey left-aligned
</p>

<p class="d-flex align-items-center">
    A cycle icon in red right-aligned
    <span class="icon red ml-2">
        {% include entypo/cycle.svg %}
    </span>
</p>

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## CSS

The markup above uses `.icon` to control the icon's size and and `.red` or `.grey` as examples of controlling its colour.

Bootstrap takes care of the layout. `d-flex align-items-center` ensures the icon is vertically aligned along the center line with the accompanying content and `ml-2` and `mr-2` take care of horizontal spacing.

The following CSS is already in `theme/css/site.css` and can easily be extended for different colours.

{% highlight css %}
.icon {
    height: 21px;
    width: 21px;
}

.icon.grey svg path {
    fill: #999;
}

.icon.red svg path {
    fill: #A00;
}
{% endhighlight %}
