I am an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Findlay.  I teach a diverse set of classes with the overarching goal of developing critical thinking skills and using data to drive discovery.  Importantly, these two goals allows us to put our knowledge to the test.  To engage in this process, we require thoughtful question and/or hypothesis, an experiment or two, and importantly, data.  By visualizing and analyzing data we can better understand what we do know and what we don't, and use that to form the basis of a greater truth about us and the world.

In my spare time I like reading and cooking.  I tend to read sci-fi and finished "Project Hail Mary".  If not sci-fi, then I am liking reading a computer programming text or a cook book.  I enjoy warm weather so I can BBQ and use my vertical smoker.  I am also trying to improve my Italian.  I am pretty good at making pasta, but am working on a pomodoro sauce and making the perfect pizza crust.
