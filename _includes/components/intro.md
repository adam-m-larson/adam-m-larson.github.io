I am an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Findlay.  I teach a diverse set of classes: from Freshman level courses, like Introductory to Psychology to upper-level courses, like Cognitive Psychology, Sensation and Perception, and Senior Capstone.  

In all of my classes, I strive to develop students' critical thinking and problem solving skills.  This involves posing an interesting research question to my students and discussing how we could go about answering.  For example, I may describe a theory in class and then ask students how it may be applied to a novel situation that students are familiar with.  One example of an experiential learning activity comes from my Cognitive Psychology class.  After reviewing Short-Term Memory (STM), I discuss how we measure its capacity (e.g., How many items can we hold onto in STM?) and task students with 1) measuring their own STM capacity and 2) theorizing how increasing stimulus complexity will effect STM capacity.  This activity allows students to critically think about how to manipulate the stimulus complexity, design a study to measure STM capacity, and to analyze their results.  Most students generate a naïve hypothesis that STM capacity will decrease as the stimulus complexity increases.  However, I prompt students to think about a situation in which their hypothesis could be wrong.  For example, I explain how a word list consisting of unrelated words may be difficult to store in STM.  However, memory may improve if those same unrelated words are rearranged to form a sentence.  Students realize that their naïve hypothesis may be correct, but that the generalizability of their hypothesis could be limited based on the stimuli they generated.  I truly believe engaging students in experiential learning and critical thinking allows them to better understand psychological concepts and become critical consumers of information.
